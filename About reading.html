        <h1>Why we should reading?</h1>
        <p class="video_description">
            Reading is good for you because it improves your focus, memory, <br> empathy, and communication skills. It
            can reduce stress,
            improve <br> your mental health, and help you live longer. Reading also allows <br> you to learn new things
            to help you succeed in
            your work and <br> relationships.
            <br><br>
            This video explains why books should be read more often so that we <br> can improve our language skills and
            our knowledge of
            the world, <br> enhance creativity and flexibility, reduce stress, and enhaces empathy

                            Reading is good for your brain <br><br>
                            “Reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body.” Joseph Addison penned <br> this quote
                            roughly 300 years ago,
                            before modern science and research equipment <br> could back up his claim. Today, however,
                            scientific studies show that
                            reading does <br> make you smarter. Reading a novel, for example, increases the blood flow
                            and <br> improves connectivity in
                            the brain.

                            Reading introduces you to new ideas and invites you to solve problems <br><br>
                            Have you ever solved a case in a mystery book before you read the conclusion <br> or
                            predicted a turn of events in a
                            novel? Your analytical thinking was stimulated <br> merely from reading. Reading helps you
                            detect patterns, solve
                            problems, and <br> assimilate new information as if you were living in the characters’
                            shoes.

                            Reading makes you a better writer
                            <br><br>
                            When you read, your brain absorbs good writing techniques and vocabulary. <br> In your own
                            writing, you will
                            unconsciously
                            copy the writing styles of books <br> that held your attention. Reading also enhances your
                            vocabulary and spelling. <br>
                            New words
                            appear in their natural context and you can deduce meaning from <br> the surrounding words,
                            while visually
                            imprinting their
                            spelling for accurate <br> recall.

                            Reading improves your conversational skills <br><br>
                            Because reading increases your vocabulary and your knowledge of how to <br> correctly use
                            new words, reading helps you
                            clearly articulate what you want to <br> say. The knowledge you gain from reading also gives
                            you lots to talk about with <br>
                            others. I love talking to people - especially little kids - who read a lot. Their <br>
                            conversation tends to be deep, and it
                            makes me grin when little ones use fancy <br> words they found in a book.

                            When you read a book with a concurring worldview, it reinforces your <br> convictions. If
                            you read a book with an opposing
                            worldview, it broadens your <br> perspective and causes you to examine your beliefs and
                            search for truth. <br><br><br><br>

                            With the modern barrage of media and instant technological information, our <br> attention
                            spans are getting shorter and
                            shorter. Reading a book, unlike skimming <br> a web page, forces you to focus. To get the
                            most out of a story, you must
                            fixate on <br> the plot and complete the book. In doing this, your brain forms deep
                            connections <br> and practices concentration. <br>

                            Reading can teach you historical politics, customs, cultures, economics, and <br> intellect.
                            Often these facts are set in
                            a context of a story, making history easy to <br> remember. When I was in middle school,
                            history was not my favorite
                            subject. <br> The dates and events didn’t capture my attention when they came from a history
                            <br> book. Historical fiction,
                            however, was a different matter. I loved reading about the <br> past in story form, and I
                            effortlessly learned historical
                            facts and concepts

                            Reading books set in cultures different from our own provides knowledge of those <br>
                            cultures and the emotional and
                            spiritual lives of the people who live there. I hope <br> to travel the world someday, but
                            until then I’m exploring through
                            books. I’ve <br> gained a deeper understanding of cultures through reading: stories of
                            hammock <br> beds, cannibals, burqas, and
                            Uganda’s red dirt stand out stark in my brain. I’ve not yet <br> been to these cultures, but
                            I understand them better because
                            of reading.

                            As you read, you put yourself in the characters’ shoes. Your brain goes beyond <br> the

                            such as appearances, emotions, and <br> surroundings. William Styron wrote, “A great book
                            should leave you with many <br>
                            experiences, and slightly exhausted at the end. You live several lives while <br> reading.”

                            Reading about something you enjoy or losing yourself in a good novel is an <br> excellent
                            way to relax. It can ease tension
                            in your muscles and heart while letting <br> your brain wander to new ideas and live in
                            someone else’s shoes. Reading is <br> a
                            mini vacation for your brain! <br><br><br>
